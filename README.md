This project was created for an inter-school competition on the topic "Democracy". As elections were close in India, various schools held competitions for promoting the need for "voting". For the same, this AI storybot was developed. It was developed in one and a half day.

Modules used:
1) streamlit (For interface)
2) gtts (For text-to-speech conversion)
3) openai (For the AI)
4) IO (For storing our speech in a file)
5) deep_translator (For translating our text)

This code can be used and edited according to your requirements. You "need" to get your API key from OpenAI's website and put it in your code.

This project has been hosted through streamlit's local community cloud, which is free to use. For the documentation of hosting your streamlit app, you can visit this website- https://docs.streamlit.io/deploy/streamlit-community-cloud
